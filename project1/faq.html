                    <h4>How do I choose a band for my wedding?</h4>
                    Having performed more than 1000 weddings in the past 34 years, we have come to realize the main qualities that brides look for in hiring a band.<br>

                    Musical Proficiency:<br>
                    Obviously, the band has to sound great! A band with great singers and accomplished musicians is a good start to creating a reception that everyone will rave about. But that’s not all . . .<br>

                    A Band with "Heart":<br>
                    The band members have to enjoy what they’re doing, rather than just "going through the motions" at another gig. A band whose musicians are close friends, and are the kinds of friends that you’d like to invite to your wedding, is a step closer to choosing the right band. You’re getting closer . . .<br>

                    The Band Leader:<br>
                    You have to feel comfortable on a personal level with the band leader. This is the person that you will be working with for a year (or longer) from the time you book the band until your reception. Qualities like integrity, honesty, punctuality, and professionalism are a must for the person you are relying on to run the show and orchestrate your once-in-a-lifetime event.

                    <h4>What if you don’t know our first dance song? </h4>
                    We will learn it! Or we can play the actual recording for you to dance to. Dancing to the recording is quite common, and for a lot of couples it removes those "first dance jitters" because they know exactly how it’s going to sound (and quite often they’ve been practicing dancing to the recording). Honestly, you won't offend us in the least if you ask us to "DJ" your first dance!     
                </p>

                    <h4>How many hours does Clockwork perform for? </h4>
                    Most wedding receptions are 5 hours long: 1 hour for cocktails, and 4 hours for the reception (dinner and dancing), and there’s a reason for that. A four-hour reception seems to be the right amount of time to create a very fun atmosphere, to get everyone dancing, and have the energy peak before people get too tired. Keep in mind that after dinner, there is continuous high-energy music until the end of the reception. The band plays two dance sets, and we "DJ" a high-energy set of about 20 minutes in between these two sets. So, following dinner, there is high-energy dance music for about 2 ½ hours straight, and that’s usually enough for most people! That having been said, however, we have played 4.5 or even 5 hour receptions in the past.
